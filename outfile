./test_files/infile_big:bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
./test_files/infile_big:picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
./test_files/infile_big:There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
./test_files/infile_big:it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
./test_files/infile_big:dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
./test_files/infile_big:what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
./test_files/infile_big:“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
./test_files/infile_big:think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me
./test_files/infile_big:at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
./test_files/infile_big:top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)
./test_files/infile_big:many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
./test_files/infile_big:be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
./test_files/infile_big:several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
./test_files/infile_big:though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
./test_files/infile_big:with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
./test_files/infile_big:glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
./test_files/infile_big:country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”
./test_files/infile_big:falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what
./test_files/infile_big:an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do
./test_files/infile_big:Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
./test_files/infile_big:talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”
./test_files/infile_big:either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt
./test_files/infile_big:long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
./test_files/infile_big:and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she
./test_files/infile_big:herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
./test_files/infile_big:glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s
./test_files/infile_big:behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
./test_files/infile_big:how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
./test_files/infile_big:knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
./test_files/infile_big:happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
./test_files/infile_big:any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
./test_files/infile_big:time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here
./test_files/infile_big:several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
./test_files/infile_big:eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
./test_files/infile_big:However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to
./test_files/infile_big:And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
./test_files/infile_big:she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”
./test_files/infile_big:not remember ever having seen such a thing.
./test_files/infile_big:After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
./test_files/infile_big:and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
./test_files/infile_big:rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally
./test_files/infile_big:for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
./test_files/infile_big:she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
./test_files/infile_big:get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”
./test_files/infile_big:She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which
./test_files/infile_big:way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
./test_files/infile_big:size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
./test_files/infile_big:had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
./test_files/infile_big:things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
./test_files/infile_big:now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
./test_files/infile_big:you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop
./test_files/infile_big:this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding
./test_files/infile_big:four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
./test_files/infile_big:she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
./test_files/infile_big:Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
./test_files/infile_big:great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the
./test_files/infile_big:sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
./test_files/infile_big:queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
./test_files/infile_big:I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
./test_files/infile_big:same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
./test_files/infile_big:thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
./test_files/infile_big:be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
./test_files/infile_big:puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.
./test_files/infile_big:Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
./test_files/infile_big:    Improve his shining tail,
./test_files/infile_big:    How neatly spread his claws,
./test_files/infile_big:As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
./test_files/infile_big:that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while
./test_files/infile_big:now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
./test_files/infile_big:found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
./test_files/infile_big:key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than
./test_files/infile_big:ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this
./test_files/infile_big:splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
./test_files/infile_big:to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
./test_files/infile_big:sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
./test_files/infile_big:of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
./test_files/infile_big:soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
./test_files/infile_big:she was nine feet high.
./test_files/infile_big:being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
./test_files/infile_big:sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”
./test_files/infile_big:Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
./test_files/infile_big:it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
./test_files/infile_big:“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?
./test_files/infile_big:Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
./test_files/infile_big:began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
./test_files/infile_big:of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right
./test_files/infile_big:way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
./test_files/infile_big:but it said nothing.
./test_files/infile_big:her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
./test_files/infile_big:anything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which
./test_files/infile_big:“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry
./test_files/infile_big:about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d
./test_files/infile_big:quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
./test_files/infile_big:paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
./test_files/infile_big:nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
./test_files/infile_big:pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
./test_files/infile_big:“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
./test_files/infile_big:_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name
./test_files/infile_big:know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when
./test_files/infile_big:of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
./test_files/infile_big:Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
./test_files/infile_big:history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”
./test_files/infile_big:It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
./test_files/infile_big:consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
./test_files/infile_big:older than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow
./test_files/infile_big:“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This
./test_files/infile_big:is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William
./test_files/infile_big:“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.
./test_files/infile_big:the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
./test_files/infile_big:“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the
./test_files/infile_big:The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found
./test_files/infile_big:it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
./test_files/infile_big:of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,
./test_files/infile_big:the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
./test_files/infile_big:that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
./test_files/infile_big:speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
./test_files/infile_big:as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
./test_files/infile_big:This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
./test_files/infile_big:forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
./test_files/infile_big:pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
./test_files/infile_big:“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.
./test_files/infile_big:Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
./test_files/infile_big:presented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant
./test_files/infile_big:thimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
./test_files/infile_big:Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
./test_files/infile_big:that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
./test_files/infile_big:to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
./test_files/infile_big:The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
./test_files/infile_big:begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
./test_files/infile_big:“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why
./test_files/infile_big:it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
./test_files/infile_big:sighing.
./test_files/infile_big:puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
./test_files/infile_big:tale was something like this:—
./test_files/infile_big:         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve
./test_files/infile_big:         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear
./test_files/infile_big:you thinking of?”
./test_files/infile_big:bend, I think?”
./test_files/infile_big:“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and
./test_files/infile_big:her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
./test_files/infile_big:“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you
./test_files/infile_big:can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
./test_files/infile_big:This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
./test_files/infile_big:to its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in
./test_files/infile_big:lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
./test_files/infile_big:eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
./test_files/infile_big:coming back to finish his story.
./test_files/infile_big:It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
./test_files/infile_big:anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
./test_files/infile_big:my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
./test_files/infile_big:moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
./test_files/infile_big:they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
./test_files/infile_big:doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
./test_files/infile_big:“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How
./test_files/infile_big:surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him
./test_files/infile_big:his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she
./test_files/infile_big:came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
./test_files/infile_big:began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come
./test_files/infile_big:don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house
./test_files/infile_big:By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
./test_files/infile_big:pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
./test_files/infile_big:this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it
./test_files/infile_big:and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to
./test_files/infile_big:happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so
./test_files/infile_big:I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large
./test_files/infile_big:again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”
./test_files/infile_big:was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
./test_files/infile_big:of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I
./test_files/infile_big:yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
./test_files/infile_big:that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
./test_files/infile_big:“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”
./test_files/infile_big:hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
./test_files/infile_big:from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
./test_files/infile_big:cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
./test_files/infile_big:help me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)
./test_files/infile_big:There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
./test_files/infile_big:hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
./test_files/infile_big:She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
./test_files/infile_big:fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em
./test_files/infile_big:together first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do
./test_files/infile_big:well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
./test_files/infile_big:fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do
./test_files/infile_big:you’re to go down the chimney!”
./test_files/infile_big:“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to
./test_files/infile_big:herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in
./test_files/infile_big:Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
./test_files/infile_big:I _think_ I can kick a little!”
./test_files/infile_big:She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
./test_files/infile_big:scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
./test_files/infile_big:saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited
./test_files/infile_big:The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”
./test_files/infile_big:then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then
./test_files/infile_big:silence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy
./test_files/infile_big:now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
./test_files/infile_big:a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me
./test_files/infile_big:window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to
./test_files/infile_big:this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that
./test_files/infile_big:again!” which produced another dead silence.
./test_files/infile_big:something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
./test_files/infile_big:safe in a thick wood.
./test_files/infile_big:“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she
./test_files/infile_big:second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
./test_files/infile_big:how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
./test_files/infile_big:feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little
./test_files/infile_big:thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
./test_files/infile_big:might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
./test_files/infile_big:and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
./test_files/infile_big:over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
./test_files/infile_big:moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
./test_files/infile_big:all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
./test_files/infile_big:This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
./test_files/infile_big:leaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d
./test_files/infile_big:suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
./test_files/infile_big:the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
./test_files/infile_big:looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
./test_files/infile_big:behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
./test_files/infile_big:anything else.
./test_files/infile_big:This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
./test_files/infile_big:who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
./test_files/infile_big:after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little
./test_files/infile_big:Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
./test_files/infile_big:think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”
./test_files/infile_big:Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
./test_files/infile_big:“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something
./test_files/infile_big:This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
./test_files/infile_big:Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
./test_files/infile_big:and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
./test_files/infile_big:think you’re changed, do you?”
./test_files/infile_big:“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I
./test_files/infile_big:“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.
./test_files/infile_big:    “And your hair has become very white;
./test_files/infile_big:    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”
./test_files/infile_big:“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,
./test_files/infile_big:“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
./test_files/infile_big:By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
./test_files/infile_big:    For anything tougher than suet;
./test_files/infile_big:“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,
./test_files/infile_big:And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
./test_files/infile_big:    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!
./test_files/infile_big:Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
./test_files/infile_big:Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
./test_files/infile_big:rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
./test_files/infile_big:This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
./test_files/infile_big:trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
./test_files/infile_big:perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
./test_files/infile_big:“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
./test_files/infile_big:violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
./test_files/infile_big:She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
./test_files/infile_big:set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
./test_files/infile_big:“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which
./test_files/infile_big:an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
./test_files/infile_big:going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
./test_files/infile_big:the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
./test_files/infile_big:hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
./test_files/infile_big:tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing
./test_files/infile_big:saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
./test_files/infile_big:“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;
./test_files/infile_big:“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the
./test_files/infile_big:Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I
./test_files/infile_big:invent something!”
./test_files/infile_big:child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
./test_files/infile_big:This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
./test_files/infile_big:minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re
./test_files/infile_big:and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
./test_files/infile_big:It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
./test_files/infile_big:right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
./test_files/infile_big:_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly
./test_files/infile_big:upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
./test_files/infile_big:_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she
./test_files/infile_big:near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
./test_files/infile_big:wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
./test_files/infile_big:otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
./test_files/infile_big:fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
./test_files/infile_big:The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
./test_files/infile_big:nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
./test_files/infile_big:Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
./test_files/infile_big:noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
./test_files/infile_big:this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”
./test_files/infile_big:she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
./test_files/infile_big:At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
./test_files/infile_big:skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,
./test_files/infile_big:and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
./test_files/infile_big:as if nothing had happened.
./test_files/infile_big:The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
./test_files/infile_big:“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.
./test_files/infile_big:“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s
./test_files/infile_big:The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
./test_files/infile_big:stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
./test_files/infile_big:alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen
./test_files/infile_big:that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
./test_files/infile_big:“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”
./test_files/infile_big:“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t
./test_files/infile_big:Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
./test_files/infile_big:be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
./test_files/infile_big:fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
./test_files/infile_big:them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
./test_files/infile_big:in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an
./test_files/infile_big:“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to
./test_files/infile_big:think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
./test_files/infile_big:the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
./test_files/infile_big:be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or
./test_files/infile_big:figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
./test_files/infile_big:    And beat him when he sneezes:
./test_files/infile_big:(In which the cook and the baby joined):
./test_files/infile_big:While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
./test_files/infile_big:the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,

./test_files/infile_big:“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was

./test_files/infile_big:to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
./test_files/infile_big:Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do
./test_files/infile_big:with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so
./test_files/infile_big:violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
./test_files/infile_big:herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
./test_files/infile_big:rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other

./test_files/infile_big:“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
./test_files/infile_big:“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
./test_files/infile_big:Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
./test_files/infile_big:Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how
./test_files/infile_big:Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
./test_files/infile_big:things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
./test_files/infile_big:which the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she
./test_files/infile_big:perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it
./test_files/infile_big:was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
./test_files/infile_big:and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”
./test_files/infile_big:“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
./test_files/infile_big:beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
./test_files/infile_big:grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”

./test_files/infile_big:cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very

./test_files/infile_big:“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said
./test_files/infile_big:say—that’s the same thing, you know.”
./test_files/infile_big:“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well
./test_files/infile_big:say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
./test_files/infile_big:I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”
./test_files/infile_big:talking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing
./test_files/infile_big:“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the
./test_files/infile_big:conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
./test_files/infile_big:writing-desks, which wasn’t much.
./test_files/infile_big:is it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his

./test_files/infile_big:nothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,

./test_files/infile_big:Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the
./test_files/infile_big:about wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”
./test_files/infile_big:“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head
./test_files/infile_big:Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything

./test_files/infile_big:“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.
./test_files/infile_big:“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—
./test_files/infile_big:Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his
./test_files/infile_big:do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”
./test_files/infile_big:tea-things are put out here?” she asked.
./test_files/infile_big:and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”
./test_files/infile_big:“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”
./test_files/infile_big:“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”
./test_files/infile_big:The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a
./test_files/infile_big:“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
./test_files/infile_big:“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t
./test_files/infile_big:take _more_ than nothing.”
./test_files/infile_big:Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
./test_files/infile_big:The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
./test_files/infile_big:“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
./test_files/infile_big:“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
./test_files/infile_big:He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
./test_files/infile_big:before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
./test_files/infile_big:think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”
./test_files/infile_big:to notice this last remark.
./test_files/infile_big:This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
./test_files/infile_big:things—everything that begins with an M—”
./test_files/infile_big:The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
./test_files/infile_big:things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a
./test_files/infile_big:think—”
./test_files/infile_big:This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in

./test_files/infile_big:painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she

./test_files/infile_big:things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
./test_files/infile_big:them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
./test_files/infile_big:Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low
./test_files/infile_big:voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a

./test_files/infile_big:you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this
./test_files/infile_big:the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
./test_files/infile_big:and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a
./test_files/infile_big:hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
./test_files/infile_big:the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
./test_files/infile_big:at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the
./test_files/infile_big:Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”
./test_files/infile_big:or courtiers, or three of her own children.
./test_files/infile_big:The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my
./test_files/infile_big:dear: she is only a child!”
./test_files/infile_big:The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn

./test_files/infile_big:tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under

./test_files/infile_big:shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a

./test_files/infile_big:startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking
./test_files/infile_big:about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t

./test_files/infile_big:“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,
./test_files/infile_big:of everything I’ve said as yet.”
./test_files/infile_big:“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
./test_files/infile_big:little chin.
./test_files/infile_big:“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to

./test_files/infile_big:“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.
./test_files/infile_big:“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle
./test_files/infile_big:“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.
./test_files/infile_big:‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”
./test_files/infile_big:“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle

./test_files/infile_big:“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
./test_files/infile_big:creatures hid their faces in their paws.

./test_files/infile_big:two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”
./test_files/infile_big:said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
./test_files/infile_big:the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
./test_files/infile_big:running down his cheeks, he went on again:—
./test_files/infile_big:said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
./test_files/infile_big:Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
./test_files/infile_big:been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very

./test_files/infile_big:“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
./test_files/infile_big:“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.
./test_files/infile_big:They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?

./test_files/infile_big:“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.
./test_files/infile_big:curious song about the whiting!”
./test_files/infile_big:“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,

./test_files/infile_big:“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said
./test_files/infile_big:Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
./test_files/infile_big:wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.
./test_files/infile_big:“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn
./test_files/infile_big:them out with his nose, you know?”
./test_files/infile_big:puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
./test_files/infile_big:begins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”
./test_files/infile_big:“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,

./test_files/infile_big:“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was
./test_files/infile_big:with sobs, to sing this:—

./test_files/infile_big:herself, “because of his great wig.”

./test_files/infile_big:“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,
./test_files/infile_big:“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
./test_files/infile_big:stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the
./test_files/infile_big:court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
./test_files/infile_big:that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,
./test_files/infile_big:“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice
./test_files/infile_big:One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
./test_files/infile_big:could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
./test_files/infile_big:was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this

./test_files/infile_big:court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
./test_files/infile_big:reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
./test_files/infile_big:This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
./test_files/infile_big:from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
./test_files/infile_big:confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
./test_files/infile_big:Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
./test_files/infile_big:that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
./test_files/infile_big:All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
./test_files/infile_big:on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes

./test_files/infile_big:“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after
./test_files/infile_big:nothing, being fast asleep.
./test_files/infile_big:The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
./test_files/infile_big:explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
./test_files/infile_big:up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
./test_files/infile_big:applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
./test_files/infile_big:without even waiting to put his shoes on.
./test_files/infile_big:“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the

./test_files/infile_big:whiskers!”
./test_files/infile_big:Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
./test_files/infile_big:surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
./test_files/infile_big:the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its

./test_files/infile_big:“Nothing,” said Alice.
./test_files/infile_big:“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.
./test_files/infile_big:“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.
./test_files/infile_big:just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White
./test_files/infile_big:said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
./test_files/infile_big:to himself in an undertone,
./test_files/infile_big:which word sounded best.
./test_files/infile_big:Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
./test_files/infile_big:At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
./test_files/infile_big:his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule
./test_files/infile_big:Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”
./test_files/infile_big:“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.
./test_files/infile_big:“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.
./test_files/infile_big:The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your
./test_files/infile_big:White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been
./test_files/infile_big:“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a
./test_files/infile_big:nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”
./test_files/infile_big:“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s
./test_files/infile_big:nothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
